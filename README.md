# Multi-Robot ROS2 Framework for Ground Vehicles

![Swarm Robots](path/to/your/image.jpg)

## Overview

This repository serves as a Multi-robot ROS2 (C++) framework designed for ground vehicles. The primary purpose is to enable swarming capabilities as part of the European Defence Industrial Development Programme (EDIDP) Integrated Modular Unmanned Ground System (iMUGS) project. The framework is developed to showcase a centralized multi-robot coordination approach using real autonomous Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) platforms.

## Features

- **Swarming Capabilities:** Demonstrates the coordination of multiple ground vehicles in a swarm configuration.
- **Real Autonomous UGV Platforms:** Utilizes actual autonomous UGVs to validate and showcase the framework in realistic scenarios.
- **Versatile Scenarios:** Includes demonstrations of various scenarios such as road patrolling, reconnaissance, resupply, and more.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have ROS2 installed on your system.
2. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
    cd your-repository
    ```
3. **Build the Framework:**
    ```bash
    colcon build
    ```

## Usage

1. **Launch the Framework:**
    ```bash
    source install/setup.bash
    ros2 launch your_package your_launch_file.py
    ```
